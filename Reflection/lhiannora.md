# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists

## Answer 1
#### The user input information can also be used to study the dynastic networks of Europe before the French Revolution. For example, European nobles used to implement complicated marriage strategies to secure wealth and land. They needed to marry both inside and outside of the family. If we have the spouse and family information for every important bureaucrat and aristocrat as user input in a system, then we can sort the information, connect historical figures by their biological and marriage connections. And because their “superpower”, interests, and accomplishments are also recorded, the sorting of such a system will enable us to understand the social conventions of the studied period better. It will also make the dynastic networks more comprehensible. 

## Question 2
#### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 

## Answer 2
#### The "researcher" should indicate the use of the required personal information in a very clear manner before the participant consents to the survey. The information provided by the participant should also be confidential. Since some of the information (for example, profile picture and email address) could be publicized, the participant should have the right to change their decision at any point. The researcher should provide the sufficient information before the survey to the participant so that the participant has the full knowledge to decide. The participant should also be able to learn about how their information is used after the survey. 

## Question 3
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

## Answer 3
#### Since I am making the dynastic networks of Europe, say the French monarchy at the eve of the French Revolution, the mandatory fields will be: Last name, first name, sex, birth place, place of death, monarch(s) served, title(s), spouse(s), and children. The participant (representing a historical figure) will have to provide true or false answers to the following fields--the First Estate and the Second Estate--to confirm their status in the three estates structure. But in order to see the connections clearer and challenge the traditional analysis of the three estates, They should also provide a family tree and a list of people in their closest circle. With all these information, we can search their name and see the people that they were in contact with. However, an abstacle would be that this discrete kind of structure does not really show the network or the web and all connections will appear linear.
